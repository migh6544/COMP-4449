# Steel Surface Defect Classification

This project applies deep learning to classify steel surface defects using the NEU Surface Defect Database.
The full experimental pipeline and analysis are contained in `Project_Code-Michael_Ghattas.ipynb`.

## Methods
- CNNs and transfer learning
- Data augmentation and regularization
- Baseline ML comparisons

## Results
CNN-based models significantly outperform classical baselines.

## Reproducibility
