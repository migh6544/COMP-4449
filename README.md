### Automated Classification of Steel Surface Defects

#### Abstract
Manual visual inspection of steel surface quality is slow, subjective, and prone to error. This project
investigates whether deep learning can automatically classify surface defects from images using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The NEU surface defect dataset, which contains six defect
categories, is used. The project follows a progression from simple baselines (logistic regression, MLP)
to custom CNNs and finally transfer learning with EfficientNetB0. Baselines perform poorly, CNNs
perform better, and transfer learning achie
